🛒 Real-World E-Commerce Automation Framework
📌 Overview
This project is a real-world hybrid automation framework designed to automate end-to-end testing for an e-commerce website. The primary use case involves logging into the application, searching for a product (e.g., "iPhone 16"), and adding it to the cart.

The framework incorporates best practices like the Page Object Model (POM) for modular, reusable code and integrates powerful tools like Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber (BDD), TestNG, and Extent Reports for execution and reporting.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

Java	Programming Language
Selenium	Browser Automation
Cucumber (BDD)	Readable feature files and step definitions
TestNG	Test execution and control
Maven	Dependency Management
Extent Reports	: Detailed test reporting
ChromeDriver	Browser driver
🧪 Cucumber Concepts Used
This project leverages several Cucumber concepts for structured and efficient test automation:

Feature Files: Written in Gherkin syntax to describe test scenarios.
Step Definitions: Java methods that implement steps from the feature files.
Hooks:
@Before for setup (e.g., browser initialization).
@After for teardown (e.g., closing the browser).
Tags:
@Smoke and @Regression to organize and filter tests.
Background: Define common preconditions for all scenarios.
Scenario Outline: For parameterized test scenarios.
Data Tables: To pass multiple data entries into steps.
Example Ecommerce.feature file:

Gherkin
Feature: E2E Shopping Cart Test

  Background:
    Given User launches the browser and navigates to the application

  @Smoke @Regression
  Scenario: Login, Search and Add to Cart
    When User enters username and password and logs in
    And User searches for "iPhone 16"
    And User adds the product to the cart
    Then the Product "iPhone 16" should be visible in the cart
🧪 TestNG Annotations Used
TestNG annotations provide fine-grained control over test execution:

@BeforeSuite: Initialise global resources (e.g., test data).
@AfterSuite: Cleanup global resources.
@BeforeTest: Pre-test setup (e.g., database connections).
@AfterTest: Cleanup after test execution.
@BeforeClass: Setup specific to a class of tests.
@AfterClass: Cleanup specific to a class of tests.
@BeforeMethod: Setup before each test method.
@AfterMethod: Cleanup after each test method.
@Test: Mark a method as a test case.
Example TestRunner.java file:

Java
@Test
public void testLoginAndSearch() {
    // Test logic for login and search
}
🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/Furqanbijapur/E_CommerceWebsite.git
cd MyAutomationProject
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure Maven is installed, then run:

bash
mvn clean install
3. Run Tests
bash
mvn test
4. Parallel Execution
Parallel execution is configured in testng.xml. You can modify the parallel and thread-count attributes as needed.

📄 Reports
After execution, a detailed Extent Report is generated at:
